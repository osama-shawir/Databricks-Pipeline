# Data Pipeline with Databricks

This project involves creating a data pipeline using Databricks, a unified data analytics platform. The pipeline will handle data ingestion, processing, and output, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets.

## Setup and Installation

1. Log in to your Databricks account.
2. Create a new workspace.
3. Import the provided notebooks into your workspace.
4. Configure the data sources as per the instructions in the notebooks.

## Usage

Run the notebooks in the order specified. Each notebook corresponds to a stage in the data pipeline:

1. Data Exploration and Ingestion: Handles the ingestion of data from various sources.
Example:

2. Data Processing: Processes the ingested data, performing tasks such as cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.

3. Query Data: This notebook is used for querying the processed data. It allows you to extract specific information from your dataset, perform computations, and generate reports. This step is crucial for data analysis and gaining insights from your data.

4. Automated Workflow: This involves setting up a Databricks job to automate the entire data pipeline. This job will run the notebooks in the specified order at regular intervals or triggered by specific events. Automation ensures that your data is consistently updated and ready for analysis, reducing manual effort and the possibility of errors.
